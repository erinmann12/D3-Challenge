# D3-Challenge

**Background**

For this project I was tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives and creating interactive elements to help readers of a mythical newspaper understand the findings. Using data from the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), I was given the choice to pick at least two different health risks facing particular demographics.

**Tools Used**

1. D3
2. JavaScript
3. CSS
4. HTML

**Project Tasks**

In the first part of the project, I was tasked with creating a scatter plot between my two chosen data variables: Income vs. Obesity. Each point in the scatter plot needed to represent a state and the state's abbreviations needed to appear in the circles. There is also tooltip attached to each circle.

In the second part of the project, I used D3 transitions to make a more interactive data visualization. I added another axis (obesity) and animated the transitions for the circle locations.

You can switch between the static and animated graphs by commenting/uncommenting out app.js and bonusapp.js. 

You will need to launch a server in order to run the interactive visualization.
